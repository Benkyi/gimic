This file describes how to compile and install GIMIC on most systems. GIMIC 
uses CMake to configure the build system. Please make sure you have at least
cmake version 2.6 intalled on your system. 

To configure, build and install gimic in /usr/local/bin:  

$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make install

If you want to install in another location:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/my/gimic ..

It's also possible to directly use the gimic wrapper in the build directory.

If you are not happy with the default compiler picked up by configure you can
override the default by doing

$ FC=myfavouritef90 cmake ..
 
If you want to build the CFOUR interface (xcpdens) you first need to build
CFOUR, and then run

$ cmake -DCFOUR_LIBRARY_DIR=/path/to/cfour/lib ..

To build the parallel version:

$ FC=mpif90 cmake -DENABLE_MPI=ON ..

Good luck!
